# discord-bot-template
A standard bot template I create a while back. Uses a cog loader and can load sub-folders of cogs.

You'll need to run the following (for linux at least, I don't know the windows version, sorry.)

`python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py.git`

Now supporting discord.py 3.0.
